Kudos
=====

Kudos is a web application that allows individuals to thank ('Kudos') their colleagues 
for doing them favours in a work context. For example, an individual in Finance may need 
data from a colleague in HR. The individual in HR has little incentive to provide this 
information under the current system, since they are in different departments. Our new 
systems provides a lightweight and easy-to-use system to formalise giving Kudos across 
an organisation, thus fostering collaboration.


See the forked repo Kudoes_Backend for the backend implementation in Rails. 

This project won the Novemver 2013 Hackin' The City hackathon.
